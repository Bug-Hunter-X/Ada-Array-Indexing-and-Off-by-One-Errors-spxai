This example demonstrates a common error in Ada programming related to array indexing.  Ada's strong typing system helps prevent many runtime errors, but off-by-one errors in array access can still occur. This repo shows a buggy example and a corrected version. The corrected version uses the array's range attribute to ensure the loop correctly iterates over all elements.  This is crucial to avoid errors at the beginning and end of the array.
